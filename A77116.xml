         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The PreÅ¿s and I have hitherto been Å¿trangers, nor did I ever intend my Pen Å¿hould Å¿crape acquaintance with it; but the deÅ¿ires of Å¿ome (which carry the force of commands) and the importunity of other Friends, calling for more Copies then I had liÅ¿t or leiÅ¿ure to tranÅ¿cribe, have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled thoÅ¿e thoughts, and driven me out of my receÅ¿Å¿es and moÅ¿t deÅ¿ired privacie.

            <p>It is too much known, how the glozing tongues of Å¿ome mercenary Orators have preached themÅ¿elves, and this kind of Preaching, out of credit; the rank flowers of whoÅ¿e unÅ¿avory Rhetorick Å¿prinkled upon rotten Names, have not only diÅ¿taÅ¿ted Å¿ome Å¿ick-brained and Å¿illy ones, but even turned the Å¿tomacks of Å¿ound and Å¿ober perÅ¿ons. So that the Preacher of a Funeral-Sermon may find his fitteÅ¿t Text in that complaint of the Prophet;

But wiÅ¿e men know the vanity of Å¿uch VarniÅ¿h, and Colors thus laid on give no complexion to a judicious eye.

            <p>They whom ChriÅ¿t cannot Å¿atisfie, deÅ¿erve no anÅ¿wer; nor will I trouble my Å¿elf further with them, then to tell them, It is more then Å¿uÅ¿picious, that they who have over-Å¿lovenly thoughts of Burial, have too Å¿lender hopes of the ReÅ¿urrection. He lays his clothes by handÅ¿omly, doth not throw them away careleÅ¿ly, that intends to put them on again in the morning. Indeed, were our minds after the Heathen Motto, <hi>Non est Å¿pes ulla Å¿epultis,</hi> There's no hopes of them that are once buried; any burial were good enough; any hole will Å¿erve no hopes: Let loÅ¿t forlorne carkaÅ¿Å¿es

<note place="margin">Jer. 22.15.</note> Å¿uits beÅ¿t with them. But let not man, a good man, a good man in honor, though he abideth not, be thus like the beaÅ¿ts that periÅ¿h.
<note place="margin">PÅ¿. 49.12.</note> Let us give him the honor due unto his name! Due indeed: For if ever Funerals were called <hi>JuÅ¿ta,</hi> as being a debt to the memory of the deceaÅ¿ed, theÅ¿e are they; in which we do not perform, but pay the Å¿ervice of this day.

            </p>
            <p>But before his burial, there's a box of ointment, which a skilful hand would open, but I muÅ¿t break, that the place may be filled with the odor of it. And that it may be the Å¿weeter, let us mingle it with Å¿ome Scripture-ingredients.

                  <p>Next for the rule of doing, it was that of the Text; He did <hi>worthily;</hi> take the word in what Å¿ignification you pleaÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>FirÅ¿t he did <hi>decently,</hi> things like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf. We may Å¿ay of his actions, as <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> of the brethren of <hi>Gideon;</hi>

                  <p>Next, He did <hi>deÅ¿ervingly,</hi> meriting much and many ways: And though we cannot Å¿ay of him as of the Centurion, <hi>He loved our Nation and hath built us a Synagogue;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lu. 7 5.</note> yet he loved this part of our Nation, and to witneÅ¿s it, declared, not long before his death, his intentions to repair and keep againÅ¿t the aÅ¿Å¿aults of time, our Synagogue, I mean that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Å¿tructure of the Cathedral at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> (as Å¿ometime his Grandfather, when Lord PreÅ¿ident of the North, interceded for the Conventual Church of <hi>Rippon.</hi>) And this I may Å¿ay was done, becauÅ¿e purpoÅ¿ed by him: For Å¿o God tells <hi>David</hi> upon his deÅ¿ign for building the Temple;

                  <p>And here I might Å¿peak of him in his Å¿everal capacities, <hi>Lord, Landlord, HuÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Father, Friend:</hi> In which he has not miÅ¿carriages to bewail like him that cried out, <hi>Omnia fui, nihil profui; I was every thing, and did nothing!</hi> For he made every Å¿tation an advantage to do good by; All his Relations were as Å¿o many cuts and channels for his goodneÅ¿s to run and flow in. But this would lay more load upon them that groan under the burden of their loÅ¿s, and give them more gaÅ¿hes whoÅ¿e wounds are deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough already; it may Å¿uffice to have named it.</p>
                  <p>We Å¿hall go on; beginning firÅ¿t as he began every day, with his Devotions. God was next his heart, he gave him his morning-thoughts, yea and his evening too:
<note place="margin">PÅ¿. 55.17.</note> Evening, morning, and at noon did he pray; four times a day, twice in his family, and twice in his cloÅ¿et, was his courÅ¿e, to which he was faithfully conÅ¿tant, Å¿ay they that were near him. God was firÅ¿t and laÅ¿t in his mind and meditations:
<q>Te veniente die, te decedente canebam.</q>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:119627:37"/>He entred, and ended every day with him: His honor neither made him Å¿o high, but he could bow down, nor Å¿o Å¿tiff but he would <hi>worÅ¿hip and kneel before the Lord his Maker.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">PÅ¿. 95.6.</note> Nothing on Earth could make him neglect Å¿ending to Heaven; a Å¿ign and evidence that he had great concerns, where he held Å¿uch daily intelligence: No queÅ¿tion but he had a Bank of Glory going on, which made him Å¿end and Å¿eek Å¿o often, Å¿o earneÅ¿tly after it; his treaÅ¿ure was in Heaven, and his heart was there alÅ¿o.</p>
                  <p>Another excellencie which will come in as a good Å¿econd to this, was his <hi>ConÅ¿tancie to the truths of Religion;</hi> the more commendable, becauÅ¿e in Å¿uch bogling and Å¿tarting times: So that it may be Å¿aid of him as of <hi>Trajan,</hi> He was <hi>Melior pejori aevo,</hi> Good, and the better for being Å¿o in a worÅ¿e age. He was fixed in flitting times; <hi>in lubrica aetate,</hi> that's S. <hi>Hierom's</hi> word. And he Å¿tood his ground in a time of univerÅ¿al apoÅ¿tacie and revolts: He was no miÅ¿cellaneous <hi>Samaritan,</hi> no temporiÅ¿ing <hi>Any thing, Every thing, No thing:</hi> He was not <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis &amp; Mobilis,</hi> like the Courtiers of

And I might tell you, as he was Å¿tayed in himÅ¿elf, Å¿o he was a Å¿tay to others: I dare not Å¿ay as of <hi>AthanaÅ¿ius,</hi> that the Church leaned on him in her perÅ¿ecution; but I may Å¿ay, that he was <hi>a refuge from the Å¿torm;</hi>

                  <p>I know not where to be next, I have Å¿uch choice. His <hi>WiÅ¿dom;</hi> let us look at that a while. To this he had a good title, whether we look at it as <hi>Science,</hi> or <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> It was great in him, but not loud: Deep Å¿treams Å¿lide away in Å¿ilence, whereas Å¿hallow rills babble in their

                  <p>As a branch of this Prudence, I may Å¿peak of his Providence, not for this life only (which was diÅ¿creet and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) but chiefly for that which is to come; knowing he could not be happy on this Å¿ide glory:
<note place="margin">Job 14.14. 2 Tim. 4.6.</note> Therefore did he <hi>wait for his change,</hi> and the <hi>time of his departure,</hi> which he looked on as at hand,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119627:39"/>and foreÅ¿aw at Å¿ome diÅ¿tance, and laid in for it. <hi>Parum viae, multum viatici:</hi> When he had but a little way to go, he made great proviÅ¿ion for it. And though he did <hi>build,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">PÅ¿. 49.11.</note> it was not with thoÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts that <hi>his houÅ¿e Å¿hould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever, and his dwelling-place to all generations.</hi> He was well acquainted with that obÅ¿ervation, <hi>That great Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are Å¿eldom long PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carried on a Building for Heaven and Earth both together; and did Å¿o little rely on this foundation in the duÅ¿t, as that he was Å¿till careful to lay up in Å¿tore for himÅ¿elf a good foundation againÅ¿t the time to come,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.19.</note> that he might lay hold on eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Another grace, and another evidence of his wiÅ¿dom, was his <hi>MeekneÅ¿s:</hi> So runs the ApoÅ¿tles rule;
<note place="margin">Ja. 3.13.</note>

<note place="margin">Seneca.</note>

                  <p>We muÅ¿t not overlook that low, but high-prized grace of <hi>Humility:</hi> He was eminent in it; this was his <hi>Å¿chola &amp; Å¿cala coeli,</hi> a Å¿chool to teach, a Å¿cale to reach heaven.

                  <p>Nor may we paÅ¿s his remarkable <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> which he both loved in himÅ¿elf, and looked after in his family. Nor did this proceed from any weakneÅ¿s of body, but goodneÅ¿s of

Indeed, his whole life was a continued act of Patience, under a Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿everal SickneÅ¿Å¿es and Infirmities; having (as it is Å¿aid of overworne Students) <hi>Bonam ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam, &amp; malam Valetudinem,</hi> a clear ConÅ¿cience, and a crazie CarkaÅ¿s.

God had laid in much of this grace, where he intended it Å¿hould be much laid out; He had given him a Å¿tock of it Å¿uit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Such was his, enduring to the end,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.13.</note> free from all Å¿uÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deÅ¿pondencie, notwithÅ¿tanding thoÅ¿e many batteries and breaches made upon his walls of earth.
